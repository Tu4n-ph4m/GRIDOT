# GRIDOT


GRIDOT is a Gene regulatory network inference using Optimal Transport and Graph-based Granger Causality

GRIDOT (1)incorporates Optimal Transport to create pseudo-multiomic dataset from separate scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq and (2) uses Granger causality to infer transcription factors (TFs) and gene relationship.

## ANALYSIS TASKS

(1) Integrating separate scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq into a pseudo-multiomic dataset.
(2) Predicting and visualizing GRNs with Granger causality assumption.


## INSTALLATION
